# My work from FreeCodeCamp:
Coding in progress...

This repository serves as a coding journal where I decided to keep a record of all that I have learnt and done thus far on FreeCodeCamp. My intention was to document my learning progress and for future references, open to all to learn from, or to witness.
I started it only after I did the jQuery challenges, so the exercises before that were back-dated, and the codes were save in a separate word document prior to my entry in Github. I have kept the code in its original form as-is, when I solved it at that time in my coding journey, and did not rewrite them. 

Current Status:
In progress with basic front-end development projects.

Completed:
- jQuery 
- Responsive Design with Bootstrap
- HTML5 and CSS

Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data. 

Now, let’s try to add two numbers using JavaScript. 

JavaScript uses the + symbol as addition operation when placed between two numbers.

Example:
myVar = 5 + 10; // assigned 15

Instructions:
Change the 0 so that sum will equal 20.
Sum should equal 20
Use the + operator

Before:
/**
* Your output will go here.
* Any console.log() - type
* statements will appear in 
* your browser’s DevTools
* JavaScript console as well
*/

var sum = 10 + 0;

After:
var sum = 10 + 10;

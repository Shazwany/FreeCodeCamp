We can also subtract one number from another. 
JavaScript uses the - symbol for subtraction.

Example:
myVar = 12 - 6; // assigned 6

Instructions:
Change the 0 so the difference is 12.
Only change the first line
Use the -  operator. 


Before:
/**
* Your output will go here.
* Any console.log() - type
* statements will appear in 
* your browserâ€™s DevTools
* JavaScript console as well
*/

Var difference = 45 - 0;

After:
var difference = 45 - 33;

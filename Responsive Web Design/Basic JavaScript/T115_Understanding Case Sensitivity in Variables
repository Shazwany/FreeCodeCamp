In JavaScript, all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.

MYVAR is not the same as MyVar nor myvar. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name, but different casing. It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you do not use this language feature. 



Best Practice
Write variable names in Javascript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase, and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized. 

Examples:
var someVariable;
var anotherVariableName;
var thisVariableNameIsTooLong;


Instructions:
Modify the existing declarations and assignments, so their names use camelCase.
Do not create any new variables.
studlyCapVar is defined and has a value of 10.
properCamelCase is defined and has a value of “A String”
titleCaseOver is defined and has a value of 9000
studyCapVar should use camelCase in both declaration and assignment sections.
properCamelCase should use camelCase in both declaration and assignment sections. 
titleCaseOver should use camelCase in both declaration and assignment sections. 

Before:
// Declarations
var StudLyCapVaR;
var properCamelCase;
var TitleCaseOver;

// Assignments
STUDYCAPVAR = 10;
PRoperCAmelCAse = “A String”;
tITLEcASEoVER = 9000;

After:
// Declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;

[The correct answer is actually just to rearrange the upper caps and the lower caps in the right format, that is like this: camelCase.]

Output: 9000

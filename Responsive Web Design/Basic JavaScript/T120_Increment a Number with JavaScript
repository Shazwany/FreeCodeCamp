You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator. 
i++;

Is the equivalent of:
i = i + 1;

Note:
The entire line becomes i++; , eliminating the need for the equal sign.


Instructions:
Change the code to use the ++ operator on myVar. 
myVar should equal 88.
myVar = myVar should be changed
Use the ++ operator
Do not change code above the line

var myVar = 87;
// Only change code below this line
myVar = myVar + 1;


After:
var myVar = 87;
// Only change code below this line
myVar++;  //This means 87 + 1 = 88

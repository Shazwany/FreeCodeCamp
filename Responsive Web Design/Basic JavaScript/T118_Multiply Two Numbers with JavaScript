We can also multiply one number by another.
JavaScript uses the * symbol for multiplication of two numbers.

Example:
myVar = 13 * 13; // assigned 169 

Instructions:
Change the 0 so that product will equal 80.
Make the variable product equal 80.
Use the * operator.

Before:
/**
* Your output will go here.
* Any console.log() - type
* statements will appear in 
* your browserâ€™s DevTools
* JavaScript console as well
*/


var product = 8 * 0;


After:
var product = 8 * 10;

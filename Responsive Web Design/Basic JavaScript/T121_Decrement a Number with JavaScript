You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the -- operator.

i --; 

Is the equivalent of:

i = i - 1;

Note:
The entire line becomes i--; , eliminating the need for the equal sign.

Instructions:
Change the code to use the -- operator on myVar.
myVar should equal 10.
Use the -- operator on myVar.
Do not change code above the line.


Before:
/**
* Your output will go here.
* Any console.log() - type
* statements will appear in 
* your browserâ€™s DevTools
* JavaScript console as well
*/

var myVar = 11;
// Only change code below this line
myVar = myVar - 1;

After:
var myVar = 11;

// Only change code below this line
myVar--;

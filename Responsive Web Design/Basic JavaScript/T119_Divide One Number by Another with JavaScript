We can also divide one number by another.
JavaScript uses the / symbol for division.

Example:
	myVar = 16 / 2; //assigned 8

Instructions:
Change the 0 so that the quotient is equal to 2.
Make the variable quotient equal to 2.
Use the / operator.

Before:
/**
* Your output will go here.
* Any console.log() - type
* statements will appear in 
* your browserâ€™s DevTools
* JavaScript console as well
*/

var quotient = 66 / 0;

After:
var quotient = 66 / 33;

Now, let’s change the colour of some of our text. 

We can do this by changing the style of your h2 element. 

The style that is responsible for the colour of an element’s text is the “colour” style. 

Here’s how you would set your h2 element’s text colour to blue:

<h2 style=”color: blue”>CatPhotoApp</h2>

Change your h2 element’s style, so that its text color is red.


Before: (CatPhotoApp text is black.)
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>

Your h2 element should be red. 


After: (CatPhotoApp text is now red.)

<h2 style="color: red">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>

Our phone doesn’t have much vertical space. 

Let’s remove the unnecessary elements, so we can start building our CatPhotoApp.

Delete your h1 elements, so we can simplify our view. 

Before:
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>

Delete your h1 element.
Leave your h2 element on the page.
Leave your p element on the page. 


After:
Hello World

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>

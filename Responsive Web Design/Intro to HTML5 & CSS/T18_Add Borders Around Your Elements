CSS borders have properties like style, color and width.

For example, if we wanted to create a red, 5-pixel border around an HTML element, we would use this class:


<style>
	.thin-red border {
	border-color: red;
	border-width: 5px;
	border-style: solid;
	}	
</style>

Create a class called thick-green-border that puts a 10-pixel-wide green border with a style of solid around an HTML element, and apply that class to your cat photo. 

Remember that you can apply multiple classes to an element by separating each class with a space within its class attribute. For example:

<img class=”class1 class2”>


Your img element should have the class smaller-image.
Your img element should have the class thick-green-border.
Give your image a border width of 10px.
Give your image a border style of solid.
The border around your img element should be green.

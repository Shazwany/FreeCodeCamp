Now letâ€™s start fresh, and talk about CSS inheritance.

Every HTML page has a body element.

We can prove that body element exists here by giving it a background-color of black.

We can do this by adding the following to out style element:
body{
		background-color: black;
	}

Notes:
- Give your body element the background-color of black.
- Make sure your CSS rule is properly formatted with both opening and closing curly brackets.
- Make sure your CSS rule ends with a semi-colon.

Before:
<style>

</style>


After:
<style>
  body{
    background-color: black;
  }
</style>

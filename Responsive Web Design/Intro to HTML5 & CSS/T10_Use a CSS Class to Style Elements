Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements. 
Here’s an example CSS class declaration:
<style>
	.blue-text {
		Color: blue;
	}
</style>

You can see that we’ve created a CSS class called blue-text within the <style> tag.

You can apply a class to an HTML element like this:
<h2 class=”blue-text”>CatPhotoApp</h2>

Note that in your CSS style element, classes should start with a period. In your HTML elements’ class declarations, classes shouldn’t start with a period.

Inside your style element, change the h2 selector to .red-text and update the colour’s value from blue to red.

Give your h2 element the class attribute with a value of ‘red-text’.

Before:
<style>
  h2 {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>

Your h2 element should be red
Your h2 element should have the class red-text. 
Your stylesheet should declare a red-text class and have its colour set to red. 
Do not use inline style declarations like style=”color:red” in your h2 element.


After:
<style>
  h2 {color: red;}
</style>
<style>
  .red-text{
    color:red;
  }
</style>
<h2 class="red-text"> 
CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>

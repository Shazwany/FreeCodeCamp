Remember that you can attach classes to HTML elements by using class=”your-class-here” within the relevant element’s opening tag. 

Remember that CSS class selectors require a period at the beginning like this:
.blue-text{
	color: blue;
}

But also remember that class declarations don’t use a period, like this:
<h2 class=”blue-text”>CatPhotoApp</h2>

Apply the red-text class to your h2 and p elements. 
Your h2 element should be red.
Your h2 element should have the class red-text.
Your p element should be red. 
Your p element should have the class red-text.


Before:
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>


After:
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p class=”red-text”>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>

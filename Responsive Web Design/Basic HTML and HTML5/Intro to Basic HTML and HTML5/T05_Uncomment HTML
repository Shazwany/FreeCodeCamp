Remember that in order to start a comment, you need to use <!-- and to end a comment, you need to use →

Here, you’ll need to end the comment before your h2 element begins. 

Comment out your h1 element and your p element, but leave your h2 element uncommented. 

Before:
<!--
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p>Hello Paragraph</p>
-->

Comment out your h1 element so that it is not visible on your page
Leave your h2 element uncommented so that it is visible on your page. 
Comment out your p element so that it is not visible on your page.
Be sure to close each of your comments with --> 
Do not change the order of the h1, h2 or p in the code. 

After:
<!--
<h1>Hello World</h1>
-->

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<!--
<p>Hello Paragraph</p>
-->

Again, here’s a diagram of an a element for your reference:

Original Code:
<p>Here’s a 
	<a href=’http://freecodecamp.com’>
	Link to Free Code Camp.com
	</a>
	for you to follow.
</p>


Code with Notes (in bold):
<p>Here’s a  (Normal text in a p element)
	<a (anchor tag) href=’http://freecodecamp.com’> (anchor tag’s href attribute)
	Link to Free Code Camp.com (the link’s text)
	</a>
	for you to follow.
</p>

Here’s an example:
<p>Here’s a <a href=”https://freecodecamp.org”> link to Free Code Camp</a> for you to follow.</p>

Nesting just means putting one element inside of another element. 

Now nest your existing a element within a new p element (just after the existing h2 element), so that the surrounding paragraph says “View more cat photos”, but where only “cat photos” is a link, and the rest of the text is plain text.

Notes:
- You need an a element that links to “http://www.freecatphotoapp.com”.
- Your a element should have the anchor text of “cat photos”
- Create a new p element around your a element.
- Your a element should be nested within your new p element.
- Your p element should have the text “View more” (with a space after it).
- Your a element should not have the text “View more”.
- Make sure each of your p elements has a closing tag. 
- Make sure each of your a elements has a closing tag.
